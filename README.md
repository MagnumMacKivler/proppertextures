# GMOD Train Shared Textures Pack (GTSTP)
A shared texture pack for GMOD train addons.

## Rules for contribution

* Follow the naming and folder location conventions

  This means you need to look at our files, see how we do things, and follow that. For example:
  
  * Don't "one-off" everything. This means if multiple builders used a type of vent, but you made the vent for one thing, don't name the vent texture `alco_metal1` or something like that. Instead name it `metal_5` or something like that, depending on what you're making.
  
  * Don't put VMTs in another folder. Leave them in the main directory. The VTFs should go into a place we made already, but you may have to make a new folder if it's _very unique_.
